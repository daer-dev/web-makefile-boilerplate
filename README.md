# Web Makefile Boilerplate

This repo intends to be a doc of reference for writing web development related Make files. It has commands related to topics such as Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku or Ruby on Rails, and some generic ones to show help or check vars existence.

I've preferred to compile it all in a single file so anybody can keep the combination that suits they best.

Any contribution via PR is welcome!
